## Subsystems

Oshen is organized into four subsystems, each in its own directory:

```
src/
├── language/          Syntax: lexer, parser, AST, tokens
├── interpreter/       Execution: expand then execute
│   ├── expansion/     "What to do": variable/glob/tilde expansion
│   └── execution/     "Do it": fork, exec, pipes, redirects
├── runtime/           State: variables, jobs, builtins
├── repl/              Interactive: line editing, prompts, history
└── terminal/          Terminal primitives: I/O, ANSI codes, raw mode
```

Data flows: **Language → Interpreter (Expansion → Execution) → Runtime**, with **REPL** wrapping everything for interactive use. **Terminal** provides shared primitives for the REPL and interactive builtins.

---

### 1. Language (`src/language/`)

The language subsystem converts source text into a structured AST. It knows nothing about execution — only syntax.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tokens.zig` | Token types, `WordPart` (word segments with quoting context), `TokenSpan` (source location with byte indices) |
| `lexer.zig` | Tokenization with quote/escape handling |
| `ast.zig` | AST node definitions (`Program`, `Statement`, `Pipeline`, `Command`) |
| `parser.zig` | Token stream → AST conversion |

**Lexer** handles:
- Quoted strings (single, double, with escape sequences)
- Operators (`|`, `>`, `>>`, `&&`, `||`, `;`)
- Word boundaries and whitespace
- Comments (`#`)

**Parser** recognizes:
- Pipelines (`cmd1 | cmd2`)
- Conditionals (`&&`, `||`, `and`, `or`)
- Control flow (`if`/`else if`/`else`/`for`/`while`/`fun` blocks with `end`)
- Loop control (`break`, `continue`)
- Function control (`return [status]`)
- Redirections (`>`, `>>`, `2>`, `&>`, `2>&1`)
- Command substitution (`$(...)`)
- Output capture (`=>`, `=>@`)
- Background execution (`&`)

**Important**: The parser treats words as opaque — it doesn't interpret `$`, `~`, `*`, or `[...]` inside them. A word like `$var[1]` is passed through as-is. Expansion syntax is handled later by the expander.

### 2. Interpreter (`src/interpreter/`)

The interpreter subsystem handles execution, with expansion happening just-in-time.

```
interpreter/
├── interpreter.zig        Orchestrates: lex → parse → execute
├── expansion/             Word and pipeline expansion
│   ├── statement.zig      Pipeline expansion (AST Pipeline → ExpandedPipeline)
│   ├── expanded.zig       Expanded types (ExpandedCmd, ExpandedPipeline, etc.)
│   ├── word.zig           Variable, tilde, command substitution expansion
│   └── glob.zig           Glob pattern matching (*, **, ?, [abc], [a-z])
└── execution/             Process execution
    ├── exec.zig           Statement dispatch, control flow, process spawning
    ├── pipeline.zig       Pipeline wiring and execution
    ├── capture.zig        Output capture for `=>`, `=>@`, and `$(...)`
    └── redirect.zig       File descriptor manipulation for redirections
```

#### Expansion (`expansion/`)

Expansion happens **just-in-time during execution**, not as a separate phase. The AST is executed directly, and pipelines are expanded immediately before being run.

**What gets expanded:**
- **Variables** (`$x`), **globs** (`*.txt`), **tilde** (`~`), **command substitution** (`$(...)`)
- **Command arguments** - expanded from `[]WordPart` to `[]const u8` (argv)
- **Environment assignments** - values expanded
- **Redirections** - targets expanded (e.g., `> $outfile` → `> result.txt`)

**Why just-in-time expansion?** Each command in a chain sees the **current** shell state. This ensures `set x 1 && echo $x` works correctly - the variable is set before `$x` is expanded in the second command.

**Control flow statements** (`if`, `for`, `while`, `fun`) store their bodies as strings and are re-parsed at execution time. This creates natural recursion boundaries.

#### Execution (`execution/`)

The executor runs AST statements directly:

- **Statement dispatch** - routes to appropriate handler (command, if, for, while, function, etc.)
- **Pipeline expansion** - converts `ast.Pipeline` → `ExpandedPipeline` just before execution
- **Process management** - `fork()`, `execvpe()`, process groups
- **Pipeline wiring** - connects commands with pipes
- **Redirections** - applies file descriptors for `>`, `>>`, `2>&1`, etc.
- **Job control** - manages background jobs, foreground/background switching

**Key functions:**
```zig
// Execute oshen code from a string
interpreter.execute(allocator, state, code) !u8

// Execute oshen code from a file
interpreter.executeFile(allocator, state, path) !u8

// Execute oshen code and capture stdout (for command substitution, custom prompts)
interpreter.executeAndCapture(allocator, state, code) ![]const u8
```

---

### 3. Runtime (`src/runtime/`)

The runtime maintains shell state that persists across commands.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `state.zig` | Central state: variables, exports, functions, cwd |
| `scope.zig` | Lexical scope chain for block-local variables |
| `jobs.zig` | Job table: background/stopped process management |
| `builtins.zig` | Builtin command registry and dispatch |
| `builtins/*.zig` | Individual builtin implementations |

**State contains:**
- Scope chain for shell variables (block-local semantics)
- Environment variables (`export`) — passed to child processes
- Aliases — command name expansions
- User-defined functions
- Job table for background/stopped processes
- Current working directory
- Exit status

#### Lexical Scoping

Variables use a **scope chain** for proper lexical scoping. Each block (if, while, each, function) pushes a new scope, and variables follow these rules:

1. **New variables** are created in the current (innermost) scope
2. **Setting existing variables** updates them in the scope where they're defined
3. **Reading variables** walks up the scope chain until found

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Global Scope                │
│   count = "0"                       │
│   name = "Alice"                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│    ↑ parent                         │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │    If Branch Scope           │   │
│  │  x = "local"  (new, local)   │   │
│  │  count → updates global      │   │
│  └──────────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each scope owns an **arena allocator** for its variables. When a scope is popped (block exits), the arena is freed — O(1) cleanup regardless of how many variables were created.

**Loop optimization**: For loops, the scope is pushed once and **reset** each iteration rather than push/pop per iteration. This reuses memory and avoids allocation overhead:

```zig
const loop_scope = state.pushScope();
defer state.popScope();

for (items) |item| {
    loop_scope.reset();  // O(1) clear, retain memory
    loop_scope.setLocalScalar("item", item);
    // execute body...
}
```

**Builtins:**

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `alias` | Define command aliases |
| `bg` | Continue job in background |
| `cd` | Change directory |
| `echo` | Print arguments |
| `exit` | Exit the shell |
| `export` | Set environment variables |
| `false` | Return failure (exit 1) |
| `fg` | Bring job to foreground |
| `jobs` | List background jobs |
| `pwd` | Print working directory |
| `set` | Set shell variables |
| `source` | Execute a file |
| `true` | Return success (exit 0) |
| `type` | Show command type (alias/builtin/function/external) |
| `unalias` | Remove command aliases |
| `unset` | Remove shell variables |

Builtins run in the shell process by default for performance. However, if a builtin has redirections (e.g., `echo "x" > file`) or is part of a pipeline (e.g., `echo "x" | cat`), it runs in a forked child to properly isolate file descriptor changes.

---

### 4. REPL (`src/repl/`)

The REPL provides the interactive shell experience.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `repl.zig` | Main read-eval-print loop |
| `prompt.zig` | Prompt generation (default or custom function) |
| `editor/editor.zig` | Line editing, cursor movement, key handling |
| `editor/history.zig` | Command history with rich metadata (CWD, timestamp, frequency) |
| `editor/highlight.zig` | Real-time syntax highlighting |
| `editor/suggest.zig` | Context-aware autosuggestions with weighted scoring |

**REPL loop:**
```zig
while (true) {
    const prompt_str = prompt.build(allocator, state, &buf);
    const line = editor.readLine(prompt_str);
    const status = execute(allocator, state, line);
    state.status = status;
}
```

**Key features:**

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Syntax highlighting | Real-time coloring as you type |
| Autosuggestions | Context-aware scoring: directory (40%) + recency (30%) + frequency (25%) + success (5%) |
| Custom prompt | User-defined `prompt` function (stdout captured) |
| Line editing | Emacs-style keybindings |
| History storage | Binary format with 10K entries, tracking CWD/timestamp/exit status per command |

### 5. Terminal (`src/terminal/`)

Shared primitives for terminal interaction, used by both the REPL and interactive builtins.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `io.zig` | Output helpers (writeStdout, printError, etc.) |
| `ansi.zig` | ANSI color codes, text styling, cursor movement, display length |
| `tui.zig` | Raw mode, key reading, and interactive terminal features |

When oshen processes input, it goes through three stages:

#### 1. Lexer

Converts raw text into tokens:

```
"echo $name *.txt"  →  [word:"echo"] [word:"$name"] [word:"*.txt"]
```

#### 2. Parser

Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree from tokens:

```
Program
└── Statement (command)
    └── Pipeline
        ├── Command: [echo, $name, *.txt]
        └── Redirections: []
```

#### 3. Executor (with just-in-time expansion)

The executor runs AST statements directly. When it encounters a pipeline, it expands word contents just before execution.

Word expansion is a **second parsing layer** that interprets expansion syntax within words. While the structural parser handles command grammar, the expander has its own mini-parser for:

```
$var        → parse identifier characters
${var}      → parse until closing }
$var[1]     → parse identifier, then parse [...]
$(cmd)      → parse until matching )
$1, $#, $*  → single special character
~           → tilde at word start
*.txt       → glob metacharacters
{a,b,c}     → brace expansion (comma-separated list)
{*.txt}     → braced glob pattern
```

**Two-Phase Expansion**: The expander uses a two-phase design to prevent conflicts between variable indexing (`$xs[2]`) and glob patterns (`file[abc].txt`):

1. **Phase 1 - Text Expansion** (`expandText`): A unified left-to-right character scan that processes:
   - **Tilde** (`~`) - at word start, expands to home directory
   - **Variables** (`$var`, `${var}`, `$var[1]`) - when `$` is encountered, parses the variable name AND any indexing syntax, consuming the entire expression including brackets
   - **Command substitution** (`$(cmd)`) - when `$(` is encountered, executes command and captures output
   - **Escape sequences** (`\n`, `\t`, `\$`) - when `\` is encountered, interprets escape codes
   - **Literal text** - everything else between special characters

   All of these are handled in a **single pass**, not separate sub-phases. When `$xs[2]` is encountered, the entire expression including `[2]` is parsed and consumed before moving to the next character.

2. **Phase 2 - Glob Expansion** (`hasGlobChars` + `expandGlob`): Only runs on the **result** of Phase 1. By this point, all `$xs[2]` expressions have been replaced with their values (e.g., `"b"`). Any remaining `[` characters must be glob patterns since all variable-related brackets were already consumed. Glob detection is simple: scan for `*`, `?`, or `[` metacharacters. Only bare (unquoted) words with glob characters trigger filesystem matching.

This sequential design means `$xs[2]_file[abc].txt` works correctly: the `[2]` is consumed during the text expansion pass, while `[abc]` survives to Phase 2 and becomes a glob pattern.

**Quote-aware expansion**: The `expand_glob` flag is controlled by quoting context:
- Bare words (`*.txt`) → full expansion including globs
- Double-quoted (`"*.txt"`) → variables expand, globs don't
- Single-quoted (`'*.txt'`) → no expansion at all, literal text

Expansion results:

```
$name          →  ["Alice"]                     (from state.variables)
$1             →  ["arg1"]                      (positional parameter)
$#             →  ["3"]                         (argument count)
$*             →  ["a", "b", "c"]               (all arguments)
$xs[1]         →  ["first"]                     (array index, 1-based)
$xs[-1]        →  ["last"]                      (negative index from end)
$xs[2..4]      →  ["b", "c", "d"]               (array slice, inclusive)
*.txt          →  ["a.txt", "b.txt"]            (from filesystem)
**/*.zig       →  ["src/main.zig", "src/util.zig"]  (recursive glob)
[a-z].md       →  ["a.md", "b.md"]              (character class glob)
$(whoami)      →  ["alice"]                     (from subprocess)
~              →  ["/home/alice"]               (from $HOME)
{a,b,c}        →  ["a", "b", "c"]               (explicit list)
{*.txt}_backup →  ["a.txt_backup", "b.txt_backup"]  (glob + suffix)
{$items}_test  →  ["x_test", "y_test"]          (variable + suffix)
{a,b}_{1,2}    →  ["a_1", "a_2", "b_1", "b_2"]  (nested cartesian)
```

**List expansion**: A variable holding `["a", "b"]` expands to two separate arguments, not one string with spaces.

The expander combines AST structure with expanded values to produce:

```zig
ExpandedCmd {
    .argv = ["echo", "Alice", "a.txt", "b.txt"],
    .env = [],
    .redirects = [],
}
```

After expansion, the executor spawns processes, wires pipes, and handles redirections:

```
fork() → child: exec("echo", args)
       → parent: wait for exit status
```

### Pipeline Diagram

**Key insight**: Parse once, but execute each statement individually with just-in-time expansion. This allows `set x 1; echo $x` to work — the variable is set before `$x` is expanded.

## Process & Job Control

Oshen spawns external processes via `fork()` + `exec()`. Each pipeline runs in its own process group for proper job control.

### When Processes Are Spawned

| Scenario | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| Simple command (`ls`) | Fork, exec in child, parent waits |
| Pipeline (`ls \| grep`) | Fork per command, wire pipes, wait for all |
| Background (`sleep &`) | Fork, don't wait, add to job table |
| Builtin (`cd`, `set`) | No fork — runs in shell process |
| Builtin with redirect (`echo > file`) | Fork to apply redirects, then run builtin |
| Builtin in pipeline (`echo \| cat`) | Fork (required for pipe wiring) |
| Command substitution (`$(cmd)`) | Fork, capture stdout, wait |

**Builtin execution model**: Builtins run in-process for performance when possible. However, redirections and pipelines require file descriptor manipulation that shouldn't affect the parent shell, so builtins fork in those cases. Even when forked, builtins run their native implementation (not via `exec`) — this ensures they have access to shell state like the job table:

```
echo "hello"           →  In-process (fast path)
cd /tmp                →  In-process (must affect parent)
set x y                →  In-process (must affect parent state)
echo "hello" > file    →  Fork, run builtin, exit (redirect needs isolated fd table)
echo "hello" | cat     →  Fork, run builtin, exit (pipe needs connected fd)
jobs | grep sleep      →  Fork, run builtin with shell state access, exit
```

This ensures common cases like `cd`, `set`, and simple `echo` remain fast, while redirects and pipelines work correctly.

### Job Table

Background and stopped processes are tracked in a job table:

```zig
Job {
    id: u16,           // Job number ([1], [2], etc.)
    pgid: pid_t,       // Process group ID
    pids: []pid_t,     // All PIDs in the pipeline
    cmd: []const u8,   // Original command string
    status: JobStatus, // running, stopped, done
}
```

### Foreground vs Background

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                          Terminal                                │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │              Foreground Process Group                      │  │
│  │  • Receives keyboard input (stdin)                         │  │
│  │  • Receives Ctrl+C (SIGINT), Ctrl+Z (SIGTSTP)              │  │
│  │  • Only ONE at a time                                      │  │
│  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
│                                                                  │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │             Background Process Groups                      │  │
│  │  • No terminal input                                       │  │
│  │  • Continue running while shell prompts                    │  │
│  │  • ZERO or more at a time                                  │  │
│  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Signal Handling

| Signal | Trigger | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `SIGCHLD` | Child exits/stops | Reap child, update job status |
| `SIGINT` | Ctrl+C | Kill foreground job |
| `SIGTSTP` | Ctrl+Z | Stop foreground job, add to job table |
| `SIGCONT` | `fg`/`bg` | Resume stopped job |

### Job Control Flow

```

    │

    │

```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Statement-by-Statement Execution

Parse all statements upfront, but expand/execute one at a time:

```zig
for (ast.statements) |stmt| {
    _ = try executeStatement(allocator, state, stmt, input);
}
```

This ensures side effects are visible to subsequent statements. Expansion happens inside `executeStatement` just before each pipeline runs.

### 2. List Variables

Variables are arrays, not strings:

```zig
// state.variables["files"] = ["a.txt", "b.txt", "c.txt"]
// $files expands to 3 separate arguments, not "a.txt b.txt c.txt"
```

No word-splitting surprises.

### 3. AST Executed Directly

The executor runs AST statements directly — there's no separate "expanded statement" type. This keeps the type system simple and avoids redundant data structures.

**AST types** (`src/language/ast.zig`) are used throughout:
- `Statement` - dispatched directly to the executor
- `CommandStatement` - chains, background, capture
- `FunctionDefinition` - name and body string
- `IfStatement`, `ForStatement`, `WhileStatement` - control flow with body strings

**Expanded types** (`src/interpreter/expansion/expanded.zig`) exist only for pipelines:
- `ExpandedCmd` - argv, env, redirects (all fully resolved, returned as `[]const ExpandedCmd`)
- `ExpandedRedir` - fd, kind, path/target
- Uses `ast.Assignment` for environment variables (with expanded values)

**Just-in-time pipeline expansion:** Each `ast.Pipeline` is expanded to `[]const ExpandedCmd` using **current** shell state right before execution:
```zig
set x 1 && echo $x    // Works! $x expanded after 'set' executes
cd /tmp && pwd        // Works! pwd sees new directory
```

This design minimizes types - we only create expanded types when transformation actually happens (e.g., `[]WordPart` → `[]const u8` for command argv).

### 4. Arena Allocation Per Command

Each command gets its own arena allocator:

```zig
var arena = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(allocator);
defer arena.deinit();  // Free everything at once
```

Simple, fast, no leaks.

### 5. Control Flow via Body Strings

`if`, `for`, `while`, and `fun` store their bodies as strings in the AST:

```zig
// For-loop in AST
ast.ForStatement {
    .variable = "x",
    .items_source = "a b c",
    .body = "echo $x",
}

// If-statement with branches for if/else-if chains
ast.IfStatement {
    .branches = &.{
        .{ .condition = "test $x -lt 10", .body = "echo small" },
        .{ .condition = "test $x -lt 100", .body = "echo large" },
    },
    .else_body = "echo huge",
}
```

Bodies are re-parsed and executed via `interpreter.execute()`. This creates a natural recursion boundary and simplifies the execution model.

### 6. Loop Control and Return via State Flags

`break`, `continue`, and `return` use state flags to communicate with loop/function executors:

```zig
// In state.zig
loop_break: bool = false,
loop_continue: bool = false,
fn_return: bool = false,

// In execution:
// 1. break sets state.loop_break = true
// 2. Loop executor checks flag after each iteration/statement
// 3. Flag is reset at end of loop iteration (continue) or loop exit (break)
// 4. return sets state.fn_return = true and state.status
// 5. Function executor checks fn_return and resets it after function completes
```

This propagation model allows break/continue/return to work correctly even when nested inside `if` statements within a loop or function body.

### 7. Two-Layer Parsing

Oshen separates **structural parsing** from **expansion parsing**:

| Layer | Location | Handles |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Structural | `parser.zig` | Commands, pipelines, control flow, redirections |
| Expansion | `expansion/expand.zig` | `$var`, `$var[n]`, `~`, `*`, `$(...)` inside words |

The structural parser treats words as opaque text — it doesn't know about variables or globs. The expander interprets the content of each word segment.

**Why this design?**

1. **Simpler grammar**: The shell grammar doesn't need rules for every expansion feature
2. **Easy to extend**: Adding `$var[1..2]` indexing required zero parser changes
3. **Testable**: Expansion logic can be unit-tested independently of parsing
4. **Quote-aware**: The expander knows which segments were quoted, enabling proper suppression of expansion in single quotes

The alternative — tokenizing `$var[1]` as `VAR_REF` + `INDEX` — would tightly couple the grammar to expansion rules and require parser changes for every new feature.
